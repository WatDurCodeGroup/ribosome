## Getting Started
Ribosome is a flat-file collection of macros that are run with [SAS](https://sas.com). Ribosome works best with SAS version `>=9.4`.

If you don't have SAS installed on your system, you can download a free copy [SAS University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) for non-commercial use.

If you're already set up with SAS and are looking for a reference, please have a look at our [examples](#).
