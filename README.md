# Hello and welcome from the ribosome team!
## What is it?
The goal of ribosome is to prodive a simple library of dummy coding syntax for the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). The main intention is to standardize the creation of analysis-ready datasets from the master <abbr title="Canadian Community Health Survey">CCHS</abbr> file. This library does not automate the reporting of indicator estimates. Our philosophy is to leverage the shared experience of analysts and researchers and say good-bye to the days of trying to solve our own problems.
## Contributing
We welcome all that are interesting in working towards a standardized base for developing estimates. Please use the issues section to submit your feedback, say hello, or give a virtual high-five :raised_hands:
